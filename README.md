CS446 has helped me get practical exposure to coding many of the Machine Learning Algorithms that I learnt in class.

1. SGD.py - Implements stochastic Gradient Descent. train is a text file that contains the labels and features used for training.

2. The folder Online algorithms and experiments contains implementations of winnow, winnow with margin, perceptron, perceptron with margin and the adagrad algorithms. Apart from that it also contains small scripts to pick the best parameter (learning rate, additional positive paramter) for convergence based on accuracy.
