1. Each of the Algorithms are coded in their own files. Any modifications to these algorithms are made on a copy of this.

2. The scripts online_algo_1a_500.m, online_algo_1a_1000.m, online_algo2_40.m online_algo2_80.m, online_algo2_120.m, online_algo2_160.m, online_algo2_200.m, online_algo3_1.m, online_algo3_2.m, online_algo3_3.m, online_algo3c_1.m, online_algo3c_2.m, online_algo3c_3.m, bonus.m are used for tuning the parameters, finding the best parameter and for evaluation.

3. The script bonus.m is for the bonus problem.

4. The scripts plot1d.m and plot2.m are used to generate the plots.
